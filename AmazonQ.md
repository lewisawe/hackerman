# CyberTerm - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
CyberTerm is an immersive browser-based cybersecurity terminal simulation that combines theatrical hacking visuals with technical accuracy. The project aims to create a sophisticated interface that simulates various cybersecurity operations and monitoring systems.

## Implementation Details

### Core Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure with terminal windows and layout
- `styles.css` - Comprehensive styling for the terminal interface
- `script.js` - JavaScript functionality for terminal interaction and visualization

### Visual Design Elements
- Color scheme: Deep black background (#050505) with phosphorescent green (#33ff33) and amber (#ffb000) text
- Secondary colors: Blue (#0077ff) for system messages and red (#ff3333) for alerts/warnings
- Text glow effects using CSS text-shadow properties
- Scanline effect with CSS animation
- Matrix-style background with semi-transparent overlay

### Interactive Features
- Keyboard event handling for realistic terminal interaction
- Command history navigation with up/down arrows
- Special key functions:
  - Enter: Command execution
  - Escape: Security breach alert
  - Ctrl+Space: Pause/resume terminal
  - Tab: Switch between subsystems

### Terminal Windows
1. Command Execution - Main terminal interface
2. Network Monitor - Visual network topology with canvas
3. System Status - System metrics and log entries
4. Target Database - Information about target systems

### JavaScript Components
- Terminal initialization and command processing
- Network visualization using Canvas API
- System monitoring with dynamic updates
- Clock and time display
- Audio effects for key presses and alerts

## Future Development
- Add more sophisticated command parsing
- Implement a more complex network visualization
- Add geolocation tracking with map integration
- Enhance audio feedback with voice synthesis
- Create more interactive scenarios and challenges

## Technical Notes
- The project uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without external dependencies
- Canvas API is used for the network visualization
- Audio elements are included but may require user interaction to play
- The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes
