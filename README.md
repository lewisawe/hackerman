# CyberTerm - Advanced Cybersecurity Terminal Simulation

CyberTerm is an immersive browser-based cybersecurity terminal simulation that combines theatrical hacking visuals with technical accuracy. This project creates a sophisticated interface that simulates various cybersecurity operations and monitoring systems.

## Features

### Visual Aesthetics
- Deep black background with phosphorescent green and amber text
- Subtle text glow effects to enhance digital appearance
- Scanline effect that slowly moves down the screen
- Matrix-style cascading character background effect

### Typography & Layout
- Monospace font family (JetBrains Mono) for authentic terminal appearance
- Multiple virtual windows/panels with distinct functions
- Grid layout with faint borders to separate terminal sections

### Interactive Elements
- Keyboard response system that generates authentic-looking terminal activity
- Special key triggers:
  - [Enter]: Executes current command with visual feedback
  - [Esc]: Triggers "SECURITY BREACH" alert sequence
  - [Space]: Pauses/resumes the current operation (with Ctrl)
  - [Tab]: Switches between different subsystems
- Dynamic command generation with realistic syntax

### Advanced Features
- Visual effects including blinking cursor, character-by-character text display
- Periodic screen "glitches" that momentarily distort the display
- Network topology visualization with dynamic updates
- System monitoring with realistic stats and logs
- Target database with detailed information

## Terminal Windows

1. **Command Execution** - Main terminal for entering and executing commands
2. **Network Monitor** - Visual representation of network topology and statistics
3. **System Status** - Real-time system metrics and log entries
4. **Target Database** - Information about target systems and vulnerabilities

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. Type commands in the main terminal window
3. Press Enter to execute commands
4. Use Tab to switch between different subsystems
5. Press Esc to trigger a security breach alert
6. Press Ctrl+Space to pause/resume terminal operations

## Technical Implementation

- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external dependencies
- Canvas-based network visualization
- Dynamic content generation for realistic terminal experience
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Future Enhancements

- More sophisticated command parsing and responses
- Additional terminal windows and functionality
- Enhanced visual effects and animations
- More realistic network packet visualization
- Voice synthesis for critical notifications
- Geolocation tracking with map visualization
